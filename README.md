# archi_wideband
 Numerical simulations for the wideband wave propagation in periodic structures

## How to get Started ?
In order to run the demo files (`parametric_inclusion.m` for example) the multi-purpose [`+pkg` library](https://github.com/MargeritPierre/-pkg) is required. It needs to be put in a "+pkg" folder and accessible by MATLAB, either directly from the working directory of from the `userpath`.
